<br><br>A literature review to answer the (sub-)research question(s) and formulate a framework and/or approach of product design management (the design (collaboration), distribution and personal fabrication process) to tackle the problem.<br>
For this the research question need to be defined and additionally its sub-questions. These sub-questions will serve as guidelines to gain answers to specific challenges under the main research question. This information will then be analysed and contextualized into a design approach and/or framework.<br>
The next step would be applying this framework/approach by creating the online platform, documentation and tools for designers to engage with the approach. These would need to be designed carefully:<br>
<br>What kind of tools are needed?
<br>The documentation needs to be comprehensible and educational for a large range of experience in designers
<br>The online platform needs to be approachable and accessible for designers, contributers, users and maybe easy customization.
<br>In addition to this a testing approach should be setup in order to provide empirical basis for the framework/approach.<br>
Because of the nature of this project it makes more sense to make students or people in the makes community use the approach to develop designs and the production documentation using the tools provided by this research. This would provide less bias in the resulting designs.<br>
These designs can then be measured based on pre-defined factors like sustainability, accessibility, producability, and possibly creativity.<br><br>

Collaboration: Dr. Rosangela Tenorio, University of Western Australia (UWA), Bio-based Materials Design Lab<br><br>In recent years, advances in ICT, including desktop manufacturing technologies, have enabled the implementation of circular and distributed production systems on an unprecedented scale. Making distributed production feasible through digital fabrication technologies can facilitate models of production and consumption that are more sustainable, promote citizen engagement, and facilitate disruptive innovation through technological leapfrogging. However, promising as it may be, fostering distributed production through personal fabrication is not inherently sustainable. In fact, democratising access to digital fabrication and disseminating Maker Culture through internet-based networks of collaborative knowledge will increase material consumption, artefact production, and waste disposal. For instance, through practices like product customisation and personal fabrication, citizens have increased their ability to affect ‘what’, ‘how’, and ‘how many’ artefacts are produced. This raises the question: How can citizens in resource-poor or constrained contexts be enabled to create sustainable solutions through personal fabrication practices?<br><br>This transdisciplinary project combines sustainable design engineering, grassroots innovation, appropriate technology, and citizen science. It explores how emerging technologies, such as digital fabrication, augmented reality, and AI tools, combined with locally available knowledge and inexpensive resources, converge to empower people in the transition to decentralised, equitable, and sustainable production systems. The project aims to develop an online platform for open-source appropriate technologies (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="open-source appropriate technologies" data-href="open-source appropriate technologies" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/open-source-appropriate-technologies.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">OSAT</a>) and personal fabrication processes that are compatible with citizens’ resources, knowledge, and skill levels, particularly in vulnerable and underserved populations. This platform will enable self-fabricated solutions through a combination of digital and physical construction processes. The project’s outcomes will include an online platform for sustainability|sustainable personal fabrication, revised OSAT prototypes, assembly, manufacturing, and upcycling manuals, as well as augmented experiences.<br>Notes: The results of this project will be available open-source and submitted to the Distributed Design Awards 2026 and Dutch Design Week 2026.<br><br>This is a collaborative effort with <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/00097167" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/00097167" target="_blank">Dr. Rosangela Tenorio</a>, an Associate Professor of Architecture at the University of Western Australia (UWA), along with the team from the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://bbmdesignlab.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://bbmdesignlab.com/" target="_blank">Bio-based Materials Design Lab</a>.

 <br><br>This article introduces the concept of distributed economies (DE) as a fresh strategy to guide industrial development towards becoming more sustainable. The concept calls for a transformation in the industrial system towards DE departing from the socio-economically and environmentally unsustainable dynamics associated with large-scale, centralised production units that are favoured by neoclassical economic drivers. With DE, a selective share of production is distributed to regions where a diverse range of activities are organised in the form of small-scale, flexible units that are synergistically connected with each other and prioritise quality in their production. However, rather than the total abolishment of large-scale production, our argument concentrates on finding a renewed balance between large- and small-scale and between resource flows that take place within and across regional boundaries. Other desirable characteristics of production units compatible with DE are elaborated. The paper concludes by calling for the deployment of the vast amount of globally and regionally available knowledge for the formation of regionally adapted strategies to create dynamically “self-organizing” business environments.<br>Johansson, A., Kisch, P., &amp; Mirata, M.

He felt that the former was ill represented in the adminis- tration and as a consequence many important decisions were taken with insufficient understanding of the basic facts. (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AJ3MJNJE?page=&amp;annotation=J4CUKJ78" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AJ3MJNJE?page=&amp;annotation=J4CUKJ78" target="_blank"></a>)<br>He also drew attention to the fact that his real concern, which passed somewhat unnoticed, was the rapidly increasing gap between the industrial nations and the developing world e those who have and those who have not. (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AJ3MJNJE?page=&amp;annotation=PC7YIY6V" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AJ3MJNJE?page=&amp;annotation=PC7YIY6V" target="_blank"></a>)<br>
I think this is better described as: those who exploit and those who are exploited.<br>
This is because the former statement implies other (non-western) populations want to be like the west. Inherently sketching a western centric picture.
<br>there is an urgent need to question the current support and coordination structures for fostering in- novation, which are focussed solely on the amount and rate of innovation rather than on the orientation of innovation towards identified needs. (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AJ3MJNJE?page=2&amp;annotation=E452RVH3" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AJ3MJNJE?page=2&amp;annotation=E452RVH3" target="_blank">2</a>)<br>A shift in economic thinking is necessary, together with a larger vision for entire production chains. Merely technical innovations, although certainly important, will not be sufficient to resolve the present contradiction. (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AJ3MJNJE?page=2&amp;annotation=8BYA9K8G" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AJ3MJNJE?page=2&amp;annotation=8BYA9K8G" target="_blank">2</a>)<br>
Even though I agree with this statement it does seem subjective.
<br>Sustainable development is the commonly accepted new paradigm. It speaks about development, economic as well as technical, not sacrifice, and as such can be accepted by all, poor and wealthy alike. (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AJ3MJNJE?page=2&amp;annotation=NPF224RU" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AJ3MJNJE?page=2&amp;annotation=NPF224RU" target="_blank">2</a>)<br>
very conformist statement, I think. Can there really be poor and wealthy people in a sustainable system? Isn't equality part of sustainability?
<br>there is a need to introduce new strategies, which enlarge the scope beyond the tradi- tional production economy and incorporate other drivers for change than mere production efficiency (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AJ3MJNJE?page=2&amp;annotation=35R77JS3" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AJ3MJNJE?page=2&amp;annotation=35R77JS3" target="_blank">2</a>)<br>Selfish interests must be identified and channelled towards common goals. Sharing poverty is not an attractive slogan.

In fact, important changes in society can and have happened in the past without dramatic changes in basic technology. (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AJ3MJNJE?page=3&amp;annotation=BX6VBC46" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AJ3MJNJE?page=3&amp;annotation=BX6VBC46" target="_blank">3</a>)<br>Spangenberg et al. [17], who states: ‘‘We are currently so hooked up on technology that we associate every major change with a need for a scientific or technological breakthrough. However, as mentioned earlier, big technological breakthroughs are not always needed for important changes in society, a slow improvement of technological skills may, when they pass a certain threshold, provide the means for dramatic changes.

This also points towards the importance of education and accessibility to achieve breaktroughs.
<br>Modern economy strives towards an optimal alloca- tion of limited resources in view of optimised pro- ductivity. (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AJ3MJNJE?page=3&amp;annotation=Y53ZWVNS" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AJ3MJNJE?page=3&amp;annotation=Y53ZWVNS" target="_blank">3</a>)<br>
I don't think this is what our economy achieves in the end. This has become more apparant last decade.
<br>the economic laws that have so successfully governed, at least the western economy, do not provide the right signals for development becoming more sustainable. (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AJ3MJNJE?page=3&amp;annotation=V6DE4MX9" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AJ3MJNJE?page=3&amp;annotation=V6DE4MX9" target="_blank">3</a>)<br>
This also fails to mention that the opesit might be true. The current economic system might have been so "successfull" because of its exploitation of the planet and minorities.
<br>Growth at the expense of competitors has been the prime strategy, economy of scale being the lone star of guidance. (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AJ3MJNJE?page=3&amp;annotation=IQTPSV4D" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AJ3MJNJE?page=3&amp;annotation=IQTPSV4D" target="_blank">3</a>)<br>One of the most disturbing cumulative trends is the unequal distribution of wealth itself. In the light of average figures, the world is becoming a better place to live, but closer inspection of the figures reveals that success seems to breed success, the rich get richer while the poor remain poor. Or worse still, the number of poor in the world increases. This trend seems to hold for both developing countries and industrial countries alike.

Is technological advance really needed or just societal reform?
<br>small and flexible actors can certainly pay closer attention to real needs and wants.

production of a chair vs a screw

 <br><br>The global society faces an existential threat if it fails to meet current and future material needs of its populations, while staying within the carrying capacity of our planet. An approach that has been put forwards to address this complex challenge is to aim to close our society's material flows through introduction of a Circular Economy (CE). This paper provides an extensive literature review to understand the evolution of material circularity concepts and strategies, and their potential for increasing material efficiency and reduce environmental impacts towards meeting the material needs of our societies in an environmentally sustainable manner. Based on the review it can be concluded that CE may have a strong potential to help address the challenge. However, this requires broadening the focus of CE from technical and economical to political and socio-cultural dimensions, adopting a whole-systems approach, aiming to redesign economic and social relations to not just reduce the impact humanity has on the environment but actually achieve a balance in human-nature relations with a planetary boundary thinking. Pursuing purely technical and economic avenues to implement CE for increasing material circulation and sustainable growth on the foundation of our current linear economic system, will not achieve its full potential. It will not be sustainable but continue to produce the challenges that we currently have.<br>Kara, S., Hauschild, M., Sutherland, J., &amp; McAloone, T. (2022).

Limits to Growth was one of the first instances where a thorough analysis of the potential implications of the linear economic system was reported [94]. The contribution from the report that, in particular, gained notoriety was the fact that ‘a linear, infinite increase in production and prosperity is simply not possible in a world with finite resources.’ This idea was solidified in Jeremy Rifkin’s 1980 book, ‘Entropy- a New World View’ [122] which delved into the historical nature of linear development and its consequences.

Cradle-to-Cradle is an adjacent systems approach aimed at transforming the industrial material flows.<br>Cradle-to-Cradle’ challenged the industry’s dominating linear mindsets of ‘Cradle-to-Gate’ (from raw material, through production, to the factory gate) or ‘Cradle-to-Grave’ (from raw material, through production, sales, and use, to final depositing of the waste stream the grave) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VVGQYZWX?page=7&amp;annotation=NSIIXZT7" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VVGQYZWX?page=7&amp;annotation=NSIIXZT7" target="_blank">7</a>)<br>in contrast to traditional sustainability concepts that focus on reducing or eliminating the negative environmental impact of human activity, Cradle-to-Cradle design seeks to maintain and even enhance the value, quality, and productivity of material resources to have a net positive environmental effect (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VVGQYZWX?page=7&amp;annotation=7NKVXZST" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VVGQYZWX?page=7&amp;annotation=7NKVXZST" target="_blank">7</a>)<br>promotes selling services rather than products, an idea referred to as the ‘functional service economy’, now more widely subsumed into the notion of ‘performance economy’.

See my comments made later on Natural Capitalism.
<br>‘Natural capitalism’, a concept coined by [58] aims to not only protect the biosphere but also improve profits and competitiveness. Based on some very simple changes to the business practices, it aims to make resource use more productive. (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VVGQYZWX?page=7&amp;annotation=RR8C4IU9" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VVGQYZWX?page=7&amp;annotation=RR8C4IU9" target="_blank">7</a>)<br>Move to a solutions-based business model by moving away from traditional business models selling goods to selling services to provide the solution e.g., providing mobility rather than selling cars and providing illumination, rather than selling lightbulbs. (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VVGQYZWX?page=8&amp;annotation=RG5LBDVQ" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VVGQYZWX?page=8&amp;annotation=RG5LBDVQ" target="_blank">8</a>)<br>
This is probably the main difference with distributed economies.
<br>The system of Natural capitalism doesn't recognise the inherent unsustainability of the inequality that capitalism brings. distributed economies argue for co-existence with nature while natural capitalism is always about ownership.<br>For example,&nbsp;<br>
how do you make sure monopolies don't exist and competition is enforced while also making sure the environment and people don't suffer under this?<br>
How do you forgo inequality created by ownership and meritocracy?<br>
This approach to a PSS centered economy will cause capitalists to own everything while workers own nothing, since everything they use is offered trough a service and is not actually their property. This system might work if all capital is communally owned and "rented" out to people by the community. However, with private ownership the risk of exploitation of wealth and power is too large.<br>Reinvest in natural capital by restoring, sustaining, and expanding the planet’s ecosystems so that they can produce their vital services and biological resources even more abundantly since the nature is seen as the most fundamental form of capital.

This negates that capitalism is about exploiting these resources for profit.

 <br><br>This paper presents an integrated literature review on how the environmental sustainability of distributed production is studied in a variety of disciplinary sources. The notion of distributed production suggests an alternative to mass production that differs in scale, location and consumer–producer relationship. Understanding its environmental implications (and thereby dematerialization potential) is regarded pertinent and timely. Key themes in the review included how distributed production can promote product longevity and closed material loops, as well as localizing production. New and closer ties between producer and consumer seemed central discussions but were underdeveloped with regard to sustainability potential. Empirical work was seen especially in research on Additive Manufacturing Processes, while the bulk of the studies were conceptual explorations with little testing in the real world as yet. This affirms the emerging nature of the topic and points to a clear need for more (and more diverse) empirical research. The review summarizes the opportunities for greater environmental sustainability as well as potential threats that could serve to guide and improve these novel practices today. It sets the stage for ‘distributed production’ to be examined as its own phenomenon by proposing how it can be characterized and suggests that a research agenda could build upon the work initiated here.<br>Kohtala, C.

<br>For Diegel et al.

There is hence need for discussion on the valuing systems behind distributed production activities involving material goods. This would serve practical, operational objectives and clarify the axiological underpinnings.

<br>Because of the heavy emphasis on frameworks and iden- tifying environmental benefits, combined with the lack of, for instance, real-life case studies, the environmental harms (poten- tially) concomitant with a decentralized production paradigm remained unacknowledged.

How about fab labs (and others)? In these spaces safety can be regulated and measured.
<br>The fabrication of new types of products may additionally render them less amenable to existing consumer recycling systems (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4RMPYD29?page=12&amp;annotation=BM79NVLM" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4RMPYD29?page=12&amp;annotation=BM79NVLM" target="_blank">12</a>)<br>it is possible the production, storage and distribution of materials and components (and their inherent impacts) remain just as invisible to the consumer as the current mass production supply chain is.

smaller supply chain and local production may give more controll and transparancy of suppliers. Possibly even trough regulations.<br>

 <br><br>Distributed manufacturing is rapidly proliferating to citizen level via the use of digital fabrication equipment, especially in dedicated “makerspaces”. The sustainability benefits of citizens' personal fabrication are commonly endorsed. However, to assess how these maker practitioners actually deal with environmental issues, these practitioners and their practices need to be studied. Moreover research on the environmental issues in personal fabrication is nascent despite the common perception that the digital technologies can become disruptive. The present paper is the first to report on how practitioners assess the environmental sustainability of future practices in this rapidly changing field. It does so through an envisioning workshop with leading-edge makers. The findings show that these makers are well able to envision the future of their field. Roughly 25% of the issues covered had clear environmental implications. Within these, issues of energy use, recycling, reusing and reducing materials were covered widely by environmentally-oriented participants. In contrast, issues related to emerging technologies, materials and practices were covered by other participants, but their environmental implications remained unaddressed. The authors concluded there is a gap between different maker subcultures in their sustainability orientations and competences. Further research on the environmental aspects of real-life maker practices and personal fabrication technologies now could help avert negative impacts later, as the maker phenomenon spreads. This knowledge should also be directed to developing targeted environmental guidelines and solutions for personal fabrication users, which are currently lacking. Potential also lies in seeking to enhance dialogue between pro-environmental and new-technology-oriented practitioners through shared spaces, workshops and conferences.<br>Kohtala, C., &amp; Hyysalo, S.

Research question of this paper.
<br>Shared makerspaces are workshops with low-cost digital fabrication equipment, typically milling machines for making circuits or casting moulds (using wood, silicon, wax and plaster); vinyl cutters; desktop 3D printers (typically using ABS and PLA plastics); laser cutters (for usually plywood, cardboard and acrylic); and often electronics workstations for microprocessor programming and project prototyping.

As I see it a (maybe not fully realized) open source approach to artifact design.
<br>The number of makerspaces worldwide is growing rapidly: to date there are over 450 fab labs and 1000 active hackerspaces (FabLabs, 2015; HackerspaceWiki, 2015), listings that do not account for independent spaces.

other participants expressed sustainability concerns in 11% of all solutions while the sustain- ability faction did so in 6%. This seems to imply a comfort the sustainability group felt with expressing their environmental con- cerns in general trends but less certainty when it came to actual solutions in a makerspace.

The other participants showed more interest in the environmental issues in making activities themselves: dealing with the materials and the equipment, suggesting better fabbing processes and considering energy con- sumption. In waste prevention the sustainability group tended to focus on reuse, while the other participants offered solutions to combat waste and mistakes within the fabbing process itself, as well as pointing out the need for better (cleaner) materials in personal fabrication.

Also elsewhere in the trend- solution mapping space, trends with clear sustainability implica- tions such as nano-technology, new material toxicity and changes in mass production were not addressed by the sustainability- oriented faction.

Environmental sustainability thus does not appear to be an overarching aspect of all or even themajority ofissues the makers consider relevant in future makerspaces.

The topics that participants expressed as relating to sustainabilit<br>
focused especially on repair, reducing, reusing and recycling of ma<br>
terials, electricity consumption and possibilities for more sustainabl<br>

Mycellium-based materials have had an exponential growth in the last years as a low energy and abundant agricultural by-product waste user, due to its simplicity of manufacturing and environmental sustainability. The wide range of experimental approaches on its applicability has been moderately unexplored in the construction industry. The applicability and practicality of mycelium based materials are currently non-standardised and existing data on the composition and processes variables are scarce. The scalability, biofabrication methods for mycelium composites, material properties of construction components are being tested at the Bio-Based Materials Design Lab.<br>

The researcher suggests that capacity building for traditional bamboo technology can be implemented in design education by improving the process of the project validation/review, introducing algorithmic, parametric and generative modelling tools (AAD/CAD), introducing alternative rapid prototyping tools (CAM), and finally, introducing evaluation tools that contribute to translate traditional techniques from design to prototyping and to bridge educational backgrounds as these become a design language of reference.
