 <br><br>With the emergence of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PF</a> many challenges can be observed in combining this with our current scio-political system. As described in <a data-href="johansson2005" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/sources/johansson2005/johansson2005.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">johansson2005</a>: 'A centralised and hierarchical production system is poorly suited for coping with this new era of open innovation'. Therefore, the current economical system needs to be re-analysed and morphed into something that will facilitate sustainable <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PF</a>. <br>One of the proposed enabling economic systems would be distributed economy. Where flexibility, sustainability, equality, welfare and innovation become driving factors of the system instead of endless increase in profit and pleasing shareholders resulting in enshittification. <br><br>Circular economy calls for a circular approach towards production and the creation of closed loop systems (<a data-href="kara2022" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/sources/kara2022/kara2022.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">kara2022</a>). Some practices within this ideology could greatly support design practices for <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PF</a> and with this ensuring more sustainable practices.<br>However, it is good to note not all practices within circular economy are compatible with <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PF</a>, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="open-source appropriate technologies" data-href="open-source appropriate technologies" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/open-source-appropriate-technologies.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">OSAT</a> and distributed economies. This is because many circular economical practices are much based around corporate sustainability, which could be criticised for forgoing environmentally sustainable practices if it isn't deemed profitable. Additionally, many circular economical practices focus on <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="produc service systems" data-href="produc service systems" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/produc-service-systems.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PSS</a> as this approach will allow companies to have control over the entire <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="product life cylce" data-href="product life cylce" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/product-life-cylce.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PLC</a>. However, these processes could also be seen as detrimental for equality as ownership (of anything) for lower income people will be a thing of the past.<br><br>No mater how great free <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PF</a> would be for accessibility and equality; <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="open-source appropriate technologies" data-href="open-source appropriate technologies" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/open-source-appropriate-technologies.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">OSAT</a>, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PF</a> and design for <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PF</a> will need a way of monetisation. This is because as <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PF</a> practices grow more widely used they will start making mass production and jobs in this field redundant. Normally this would only mean a shift of these workers to this new field, but this does mean <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PF</a> services and products will need to be monetised in one way or the other.<br>
Of course this would be a good chance to question the need for monetisation and whether this really benefits sustainability and equality. However, other then 'this is out of scope for this assignment' it is good to recognise that systems can't just change overnight. Therefore, some form of compatibility with the current system will always be required for a transformative movement. <br>Some possible solutions to this monetisation problem may be found in <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="open source-software" data-href="open source-software" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/open-source-software.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">OSS</a>. This could be systems such as: <br>
<br>anything as a service: where base software is free but hosting and support is monetised.
<br>free individual licences: where individuals can use the software for free but businesses and large organisations need to pay.
<br>Donations: where a service is kept going by the patronage of its users.
<br>premium features: the base version of the software is <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="free open-source software" data-href="free open-source software" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/free-open-source-software.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">FOSS</a> but advanced features are monetised.
<br>Some other possible monetisation methods could also be imagined like:<br>
<br>Subscriptions: 

<br>people would have a subscription to a makers space in order to use it, materials would need to be provided by the user or bought from the makers space (another possible form of revenue).
<br>People would have a subscription to access digital artefacts on a platform contributers (designers) would have free access. 


<br>Pay what you can: payment for digital products and production would be respective to your income.
<br>market space: designers could be hired to make custom digital artefacts or customise existing artefacts for people that don't want to do it themselves. 
<br>This would then all be applied in some way to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PF</a>. Of course, trough unforeseen developments and distributed economies new forms of monetisation could always emerge.]]></description><link>https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/notes/environment/problem-space/steepv/economic.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Notes/Environment/Problem space/STEEPV/Economic.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Thijs Warnars]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 12:47:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Environmental]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>The current consumerist and throwaway culture is currently one of the biggest challenges to tackle with respect to sustainable <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PF</a> implementation. As discussed in <a data-href="kara2022" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/sources/kara2022/kara2022.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">kara2022</a>, consumerism is responsible for what we know as 'throwaway society'. This is one of the biggest reasons for the growing societal affluence. In order to create more sustainable practices in makers spaces but also broader society a shift away from consumerism is required. A system where:<br>
<br>long time use and repair goes before novelty and replacement. 
<br>waste doesn't exist because everything can be reused, repurposed or recycled.
<br>over consumption and excessive affluence is looked down upon.
<br>However, this change is more easily described then achieved. thorough planning, time, consensus, and teamwork will be required to achieve this change.<br><br>The more production practices decentralise the more important local sustainable material acquisition is. As production becomes more distributed it becomes more of a challenge and polluting to transport materials to these production sites from far away places. Therefore, to ensure sustainability renewable materials need to be sourced locally.<br>This could be a great benefit as local sourcing of materials stimulates local communities, jobs and culture. However, this does mean more research needs to be done on different types of materials for <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="additive manufacturing" data-href="additive manufacturing" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/additive-manufacturing.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">AM</a> production as different places might not allow for access to the same raw materials (<a data-href="Rosangela2022" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/sources/rosangela2022/rosangela2022.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Rosangela2022</a>).<br><br>As open-source development is a (often) democratic community driven development style.

Therefore, ways need to be found to inform and motivate digital open-source designers to design sustainably or even make sustainability inherent within digital artefact production through designed design limitations within CAD, CAM or distribution platforms.<br>
Of course, the latter of these suggestions may lead to limitations of creativity and with that innovation. However, it may also increase creativity towards designing new solutions within the constraints of the environment. ]]></description><link>https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/notes/environment/problem-space/steepv/environmental.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Notes/Environment/Problem space/STEEPV/Environmental.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Thijs Warnars]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 13:39:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Political]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Because of the high amount of production freedom <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PF</a> might allow individuals to obtain 'weapons of individual destruction' such as fire arms (<a data-href="gershenfeld2012" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/sources/gershenfeld2012/gershenfeld2012.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">gershenfeld2012</a>).

The challenges observed in regulating digital software and content like social media would likely also be a challenge for digital artefacts.

Will the digital space regulate itself as long as proper education is provided or is regulation a better approach with possible limitations on creativity and sharing ideas?]]></description><link>https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/notes/environment/problem-space/steepv/political.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Notes/Environment/Problem space/STEEPV/Political.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Thijs Warnars]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 07:37:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Social]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Giving people the ability to produce their own electronic devices with much more ease then ever before. Additionally this also brings the idea of locally producing full new AM tools using other AM tools closer <a data-href="gershenfeld2012" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/sources/gershenfeld2012/gershenfeld2012.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">gershenfeld2012</a>.

Therefore, it is important to make sure the educational material is well made and existing makers are property informed about sustainability and their responsibility in this. The latter is especially concerning as currently knowledge and consideration of sustainability seems to be lacking in makers communities (<a data-href="kohtala2015" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/sources/kohtala2015/kohtala2015.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">kohtala2015</a>).<br>Additionally, as noted in <a data-href="kohtala2015" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/sources/kohtala2015/kohtala2015.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">kohtala2015</a> pro-environmental maker did pay much more attention to sustainability of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="additive manufacturing" data-href="additive manufacturing" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/additive-manufacturing.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">AM</a> solutions, design and design space.

Just like some already widely used <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="additive manufacturing" data-href="additive manufacturing" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/additive-manufacturing.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">AM</a> tools safety is a concern due to toxicity of materials and other possible dangers that come with the production process.

In the paper these devices are described as follows:<br>'Unlike 3-d printers today, these will be able to build complete functional systems at once, with no need for parts to be assembled.

As described in <a data-href="johansson2005" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/sources/johansson2005/johansson2005.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">johansson2005</a>: 'A centralised and hierarchical production system is poorly suited for coping with this new era of open innovation'. Therefore, the current economical system needs to be re-analysed and morphed into something that will facilitate sustainable <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PF</a>. <br>One of the proposed enabling economic systems would be distributed economy. Where flexibility, sustainability, equality, welfare and innovation become driving factors of the system instead of endless increase in profit and pleasing shareholders resulting in enshittification. <br><br>Circular economy calls for a circular approach towards production and the creation of closed loop systems (<a data-href="kara2022" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/sources/kara2022/kara2022.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">kara2022</a>). Some practices within this ideology could greatly support design practices for <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PF</a> and with this ensuring more sustainable practices.<br>However, it is good to note not all practices within circular economy are compatible with <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PF</a>, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="open-source appropriate technologies" data-href="open-source appropriate technologies" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/open-source-appropriate-technologies.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">OSAT</a> and distributed economies. This is because many circular economical practices are much based around corporate sustainability, which could be criticised for forgoing environmentally sustainable practices if it isn't deemed profitable. Additionally, many circular economical practices focus on <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="produc service systems" data-href="produc service systems" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/produc-service-systems.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PSS</a> as this approach will allow companies to have control over the entire <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="product life cylce" data-href="product life cylce" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/product-life-cylce.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PLC</a>. However, these processes could also be seen as detrimental for equality as ownership (of anything) for lower income people will be a thing of the past.<br><br>No mater how great free <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PF</a> would be for accessibility and equality; <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="open-source appropriate technologies" data-href="open-source appropriate technologies" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/open-source-appropriate-technologies.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">OSAT</a>, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PF</a> and design for <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PF</a> will need a way of monetisation. This is because as <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PF</a> practices grow more widely used they will start making mass production and jobs in this field redundant. Normally this would only mean a shift of these workers to this new field, but this does mean <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PF</a> services and products will need to be monetised in one way or the other.<br>
Of course this would be a good chance to question the need for monetisation and whether this really benefits sustainability and equality. However, other then 'this is out of scope for this assignment' it is good to recognise that systems can't just change overnight. Therefore, some form of compatibility with the current system will always be required for a transformative movement. <br>Some possible solutions to this monetisation problem may be found in <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="open source-software" data-href="open source-software" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/open-source-software.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">OSS</a>. This could be systems such as: <br>
<br>anything as a service: where base software is free but hosting and support is monetised.
<br>free individual licences: where individuals can use the software for free but businesses and large organisations need to pay.
<br>Donations: where a service is kept going by the patronage of its users.
<br>premium features: the base version of the software is <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="free open-source software" data-href="free open-source software" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/free-open-source-software.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">FOSS</a> but advanced features are monetised.
<br>Some other possible monetisation methods could also be imagined like:<br>
<br>Subscriptions: 

<br>people would have a subscription to a makers space in order to use it, materials would need to be provided by the user or bought from the makers space (another possible form of revenue).
<br>People would have a subscription to access digital artefacts on a platform contributers (designers) would have free access. 


<br>Pay what you can: payment for digital products and production would be respective to your income.
<br>market space: designers could be hired to make custom digital artefacts or customise existing artefacts for people that don't want to do it themselves. 
<br>This would then all be applied in some way to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PF</a>. Of course, trough unforeseen developments and distributed economies new forms of monetisation could always emerge.<br><br>Environmental<br><br><br>The current consumerist and throwaway culture is currently one of the biggest challenges to tackle with respect to sustainable <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PF</a> implementation. As discussed in <a data-href="kara2022" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/sources/kara2022/kara2022.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">kara2022</a>, consumerism is responsible for what we know as 'throwaway society'. This is one of the biggest reasons for the growing societal affluence. In order to create more sustainable practices in makers spaces but also broader society a shift away from consumerism is required. A system where:<br>
<br>long time use and repair goes before novelty and replacement. 
<br>waste doesn't exist because everything can be reused, repurposed or recycled.
<br>over consumption and excessive affluence is looked down upon.
<br>However, this change is more easily described then achieved. thorough planning, time, consensus, and teamwork will be required to achieve this change.<br><br>The more production practices decentralise the more important local sustainable material acquisition is. As production becomes more distributed it becomes more of a challenge and polluting to transport materials to these production sites from far away places. Therefore, to ensure sustainability renewable materials need to be sourced locally.<br>This could be a great benefit as local sourcing of materials stimulates local communities, jobs and culture. However, this does mean more research needs to be done on different types of materials for <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="additive manufacturing" data-href="additive manufacturing" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/additive-manufacturing.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">AM</a> production as different places might not allow for access to the same raw materials (<a data-href="Rosangela2022" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/sources/rosangela2022/rosangela2022.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Rosangela2022</a>).<br><br>As open-source development is a (often) democratic community driven development style. Sustainability might not be taken into account if not considered by the main contributes<a data-href="kohtala2015" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/sources/kohtala2015/kohtala2015.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">kohtala2015</a>. Therefore, ways need to be found to inform and motivate digital open-source designers to design sustainably or even make sustainability inherent within digital artefact production through designed design limitations within CAD, CAM or distribution platforms.<br>
Of course, the latter of these suggestions may lead to limitations of creativity and with that innovation. However, it may also increase creativity towards designing new solutions within the constraints of the environment. <br><br>Political<br><br><br>since 1990 the EU <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="sustainable development goals" data-href="sustainable development goals" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/sustainable-development-goals.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">SDG</a>s have been defined in EU treaties as long term goals for external and internal policies (<a data-href="eu-lex" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/sources/eu-lex/eu-lex.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">eu-lex</a>). Now these <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="sustainable development goals" data-href="sustainable development goals" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/sustainable-development-goals.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">SDG</a>s are at the heart of the EU 2030 agenda, for instance being taken up in <a data-href="vonderleyen2024" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/sources/vonderleyen2024/vonderleyen2024.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vonderleyen2024</a>'s political guidelines of 2024 until 2029.<br>These guidelines may enable research and development of sustainable <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PF</a> practices and experimentation trough distributed economical practices. For instance, trough the support of programs such as <a data-href="eu-horizon" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/sources/eu-horizon/eu-horizon.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">eu-horizon</a>. The great focus of the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="sustainable development goals" data-href="sustainable development goals" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/sustainable-development-goals.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">SDG</a>s on equality and sustainability also indicates many possibilities for sustainable <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PF</a> support by these policies.<br><br>Apart from safety concerns of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PF</a> for the user (during the production process), like toxic fumes or other physical hazards, there are also other safety concerns to worry about. Because of the high amount of production freedom <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PF</a> might allow individuals to obtain 'weapons of individual destruction' such as fire arms (<a data-href="gershenfeld2012" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/sources/gershenfeld2012/gershenfeld2012.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">gershenfeld2012</a>). This concern might lead to regulatory issues as the distributed nature of the production process is hard to regulate and control. <br><br>Due to the digital nature of artefacts within the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PF</a> process questions arise on the method of regulating these products. The challenges observed in regulating digital software and content like social media would likely also be a challenge for digital artefacts. Therefore, similar question may also arise around this problem, such as: what content should be censored and where to draw the line?<br>This is already a sensitive topic when it comes to the regulation of non-<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PF</a> digital content.

Will the digital space regulate itself as long as proper education is provided or is regulation a better approach with possible limitations on creativity and sharing ideas?<br><br>Value<br><br><br>as described in <a data-href="dacostajunior2024" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/sources/dacostajunior2024/dacostajunior2024.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">dacostajunior2024</a> one of the critical challenges of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PF</a> to overcome is: 'intellectual property considerations regarding using and sharing protected designs'. When looking at <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="open source-software" data-href="open source-software" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/open-source-software.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">OSS</a> as example the solution to this problem seems trivial. digital artefacts and designs will be protected by similar licenses as <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="open source-software" data-href="open source-software" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/open-source-software.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">OSS</a> and trough this proper conduct of sharing and usage is maintained by the community. However, it could be imagined this problem will cause more challenges if <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PF</a> design is implemented on a larger scale. Especially when monetisation for designers starts playing an important role within the maintenance of the system. <br><br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="open source-software" data-href="open source-software" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/open-source-software.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">OSS</a> is currently the closest similar practising field as <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PF</a>. Therefore, it is important to look to this field and see the accomplishments and pitfalls already found in this field. These experiences may prove to be great assets towards the successful implementation of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="open-source appropriate technologies" data-href="open-source appropriate technologies" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/open-source-appropriate-technologies.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">OSAT</a>, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PF</a> and design of digital artefacts. This goes hand in hand with analysing the philosophy behind the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="open source-software" data-href="open source-software" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/open-source-software.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">OSS</a> movement and its applicability of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="open-source appropriate technologies" data-href="open-source appropriate technologies" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/open-source-appropriate-technologies.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">OSAT</a> and <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PF</a>.<br><br>As AI is more and more widely used questions about the appropriateness of the current use of the technology start getting more relevant. When it comes to sustainable <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PF</a> the benefits of AI for improving sustainable practices and plausible designs can be imagined. However, also in the context of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="open-source appropriate technologies" data-href="open-source appropriate technologies" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/open-source-appropriate-technologies.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">OSAT</a> the question of appropriateness of AI is very relevant. Especially considering concerns about over-reliance on AI, sustainability issues and usage of intellectual and open-source property without permission or proper license usage. therefore, ethical and appropriate ways of using AI need to be explored for usage in <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="open-source appropriate technologies" data-href="open-source appropriate technologies" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/open-source-appropriate-technologies.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">OSAT</a>.<br>Lastly, it is also important to mention AI's sensitivity to orchestrated misinformation campaigns and propaganda. Due the the nontransparent practices of AI providers it is never certain what information is fed to the AI models but also what information is censored or promoted. <br><br><br><img alt="Notes/Environment/Problem space/attachments/problem framing.jpg" src="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/notes/environment/problem-space/attachments/problem-framing.jpg">]]></description><link>https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/notes/environment/problem-space/problem-scope.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Notes/Environment/Problem space/Problem scope.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Thijs Warnars]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 09:10:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/notes/environment/problem-space/attachments/steepv.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/notes/environment/problem-space/attachments/steepv.jpg"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[<a data-href="Stakeholder map" href="notes/knowledge-base/frameworks/stakeholder-map.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Stakeholder map</a>]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br><br>How can citizens in resource-poor or constrained contexts be enabled to create sustainable solutions through personal fabrication practices?<br>I think a broader approach would be beneficial to the research. Considering accessibility to vulnerable and undeserved populations is very impotent. However, I don't this this is where the main sustainability concern lies. Rather the most pollution comes from resource rich environments due to over consumption and throwaway culture.<br>
Therefore, the main focus should be making a open-source (co-)design approach for personal fabrication ensuring sustainability.  This approach should also make sure the designs are accessible all populations as equality is a prerequisite for sustainability.<br>For instance rephrasing the question to:<br>How can sustainability be ensured in personal fabrication practices by design?<br>Sub-questions<br>
<br>
Main

<br>How to ensure accessibility of personal fabrication to all population groups enforcing equality and community while maintaining sustainability?
<br>How to ensure sustainability while not or minimally hindering the creative process and innovation?
<br>How to fit sustainable personal fabrication and open-source appropriate design practices within the current system on a large scale?

<br>legislation, monetisation, intellectual property, culture, material supply




<br>
Defining terms:

<br>How is sustainability defined?
<br>What is personal fabrication, and what is not?


<br>
Implementation:

<br>What communication, education or other tools can be used to encourage or even ensure sustainable development?
<br>What are current approaches to open-source and co-design of physical and non-physical products and how could these practices be applied to this case?
<br>If an inexperienced person wants to start <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">fabbing</a> how can I find a clear way where to start?


<br><br>A literature review to answer the (sub-)research question(s) and formulate a framework and/or approach of product design management (the design (collaboration), distribution and personal fabrication process) to tackle the problem.<br>
For this the research question need to be defined and additionally its sub-questions. These sub-questions will serve as guidelines to gain answers to specific challenges under the main research question. This information will then be analysed and contextualised into a design approach and/or framework.<br>
The next step would be applying this framework/approach by creating the online platform, documentation and tools for designers to engage with the approach. These would need to be designed carefully:<br>
<br>What kind of tools are needed?
<br>The documentation needs to be comprehensible and educational for a large range of experience in designers
<br>The online platform needs to be approachable and accessible for designers, contributors, users and maybe easy customisation.
<br>In addition to this a testing approach should be setup in order to provide empirical basis for the framework/approach.<br>
Because of the nature of this project it makes more sense to make students or people in the makes community use the approach to develop designs and the production documentation using the tools provided by this research. This would provide less bias in the resulting designs.<br>
These designs can then be measured based on pre-defined factors like sustainability, accessibility, producability, and possibly creativity.<br><br>

 <br>This page is just to note down some of my ideas linked to the research. They will not necessarily be implemented but noted non the less.<br><br>Creating an add-in for CAD/CAM programs that help ensure sustainable design practices. Using this approach a sustainable database of design practices, materials, fasteners, FEM and even live PLC calculations could be integrated closely into the digital design process.<br><br>imagine a museum exhibition with artists sustainable furniture and house decoration displayed. The visitors could come and marvel at the art and craftsmanship but also have to possibility to buy a copy of the items themselves printed in the fablab.<br>
I think this could already be possible at places like CODA (apeldoorn) where they have exibitions but also a fablab.<br>Similar to the Bauhaus movement. Bauhaus marked the change to industrialised furniture away form craftsmanship and with that from art to design.<br>
The movement of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">fabbing</a> could be seen as a new revolution. Due to the flexible nature of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="additive manufacturing" data-href="additive manufacturing" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/additive-manufacturing.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">AM</a> artist will have more freedom to customize and express themselves in household items much like craftsmanship did. However, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">fabbing</a> and open-source design will also allow designers and engineers to add their knowledge while still being able to produce products on a massive scale.<br>Therefore, new approaches should be taken to bring <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">fabbing</a> into the public eye while also making sure it is accessible for all who are interested.<br><br>A current problem observed with sustainability with personal <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="additive manufacturing" data-href="additive manufacturing" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/additive-manufacturing.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">AM</a> is over consumption, fabrication and with this wastage. This is because users of these technology still have consumerist mindsets towards the technology. Causing then to be enrolled with the novelty, low price and ease of protection and therefore overfabricating.<br>This doesn't mean <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">fabbing</a> will be inherently wasteful. It does mean that placing a novel decentralized production method in the hands of consumers, who have known nothing other then throwaway culture for most if not their entire lives, will not just transform them into sustainable <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="open-source appropriate technologies" data-href="open-source appropriate technologies" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/open-source-appropriate-technologies.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">OSAT</a> consumers and makers.<br>
People will need education and a readjustment of attitude in order to allow for this shift over time. We cannot expect to but these technologies in peoples hands and just see the transformation happen.<br>Therefore, I believe this should be reflected in the way we design approaches, frameworks and entire systems. Instead of designing for the now we should the design for what will be, what we want to be.<br>
However, this approach risks incompatibility and nonacceptance within the current times. This is why a vision is first created. The vision describes in broad terms the future that should be achieved and the technologies that are present in this future. Then steps are taken back from this future to current times, creating a timeline of technologies and steps that would (probably) happen. The concept will then be developed within the future time frame of about 10 years, creating a concept that will still fit in the current time but is made to strive for that specific future.<br><br>As personal production becomes more popular and widely applied environmental concerns increase. If <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="personal fabrication" data-href="personal fabrication" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/personal-fabrication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">fabbing</a> in a non-controlled setting will be likely to cause more waste then is necessary.<br>
Therefore, it is of great importance to first ensure sustainability of design before releasing tools and effort to attract more people on a large scale.]]></description><link>https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/notes/project-proposal/orientation/ideas.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Notes/Project proposal/Orientation/Ideas.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Thijs Warnars]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 11:45:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[DSR grid]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br><br>Personal fabrication<br>
'The emergence of manufacturing at a personal level has been supported by the declining cost of desktop digital fabrication technologies, the increase of distributed production through collaborative making spaces and the dissemination of the Maker Culture on the internet. This paradigm shift in production is called personal fabrication and provides people with access to new production practices, increased capability and cutting-edge technologies.'

Sustainability<br>
‘Sustainable Development is positive socioeconomic change that does not undermine the ecological and social systems upon which the communities and society are dependant.

Collaboration: Dr. Rosangela Tenorio, University of Western Australia (UWA), Bio-based Materials Design Lab<br><br>In recent years, advances in ICT, including desktop manufacturing technologies, have enabled the implementation of circular and distributed production systems on an unprecedented scale. Making distributed production feasible through digital fabrication technologies can facilitate models of production and consumption that are more sustainable, promote citizen engagement, and facilitate disruptive innovation through technological leapfrogging. However, promising as it may be, fostering distributed production through personal fabrication is not inherently sustainable. In fact, democratising access to digital fabrication and disseminating Maker Culture through internet-based networks of collaborative knowledge will increase material consumption, artefact production, and waste disposal. For instance, through practices like product customisation and personal fabrication, citizens have increased their ability to affect ‘what’, ‘how’, and ‘how many’ artefacts are produced. This raises the question: How can citizens in resource-poor or constrained contexts be enabled to create sustainable solutions through personal fabrication practices?<br><br>This transdisciplinary project combines sustainable design engineering, grassroots innovation, appropriate technology, and citizen science. It explores how emerging technologies, such as digital fabrication, augmented reality, and AI tools, combined with locally available knowledge and inexpensive resources, converge to empower people in the transition to decentralised, equitable, and sustainable production systems. The project aims to develop an online platform for open-source appropriate technologies (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="open-source appropriate technologies" data-href="open-source appropriate technologies" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/terms/open-source-appropriate-technologies.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">OSAT</a>) and personal fabrication processes that are compatible with citizens’ resources, knowledge, and skill levels, particularly in vulnerable and underserved populations.

 <br>In recent years, advances in ICT, including desktop manufacturing technologies, have enabled the implementation of circular and distributed production systems on an unprecedented scale. Making distributed production feasible through digital fabrication technologies can facilitate models of production and consumption that are more sustainable, promote citizen engagement, and facilitate disruptive innovation through technological leapfrogging.

In fact, democratising access to digital fabrication and disseminating Maker Culture through internet-based networks of collaborative knowledge will increase material consumption, artifact production, and waste disposal. For instance, through practices like product customisation and personal fabrication (da Costa Junior et al., 2024). Therefore, the question is posed:<br>How can sustainability be ensured in personal fabrication by design?<br>This transdisciplinary project combines sustainable design engineering, grassroots innovation, appropriate technology, and citizen science. It explores how emerging technologies, such as digital fabrication, augmented reality, and ethical AI tools, combined with locally available knowledge and inexpensive resources, converge to empower people in the transition to decentralised, equitable, and sustainable production systems. The project aims to develop an online platform for open-source appropriate technologies open-source appropriate technologies (OSAT) and personal fabrication processes that are compatible with citizens’ resources, knowledge, and skill levels, particularly in vulnerable and underserved populations. This platform will enable self-fabricated solutions through a combination of digital and physical construction processes. The project’s outcomes will include an online platform for sustainable personal fabrication, revised OSAT prototypes, assembly, manufacturing, and upcycling manuals, as well as augmented experiences (da Costa Junior et al., 2024).<br><img alt="DSR grid.jpg" src="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/notes/project-proposal/attachments/dsr-grid.jpg"><br>
Figure 1: Filled DSR grid describing this project<br><br>This assignment will take a Design Science Research (DSR) approach (Maedche et al., 2020). The approach and description of the assignment are described using the DSR grid (Maedche et al., 2020), as can be seen in figure 1.<br>First, the environment (problem space) will be defined and contextualised using different tools and frameworks like stakeholder maps and STEEPV cards. Next to this a knowledge base will be build containing different frameworks, methodologies and literature. The following papers will act as the groundwork for this project: (Gershenfeld, 2012; Johansson et al., 2005; Kohtala, 2015; Kohtala &amp; Hyysalo, 2015; Rosangela &amp; da Costa, 2022) and mainly (da Costa Junior et al., 2024). Further literature research will be conducted to broaden both the environment (problem/solution space) and the knowledge base.<br>After initial building of the environment and knowledge base the design phase will start. Here artifact and theory building will be done in an iterative process with empirical evaluation of the results. During this process applications will be made for in the environment (solution space) and additions will be made to the knowledge base.<br>The final deliverables of this project will be the platform for OSAT as described earlier and a design methodology for designing open-source sustainable products for personal fabrication. This methodology will be delivered along side a set of tools that designers can use to apply this methodology.<br><br>Personal fabrication is an upcoming topic that could have many implications for sustainable production, as said in da Costa Junior et al., 2024: ‘Research on personal fabrication needs to be conducted while this phenomenon is still at its early stage so that improvements can be made to ensure a future compatible with sustainable development goals.’<br>Personal fabrication could completely reshape how products are made and distributed and might even mark a new industrial revolution. This gives companies, governments, civilians and researchers a chance to shape this systems as it comes to be. Making it more important then ever to map different perspectives and approaches in order to provide the priorly mentioned stakeholders with the proper tools to shape this transition in a favourable way.<br>Lastly, this assignment offers the graduation student a great opportunity to explore new technologies, methodologies, design practices and gain more experience in empirical academic practices providing great educational value.<br><br>da Costa Junior, J., Tenorio, R., &amp; dos Santos, A.

 <br><br>Despite the potential of personal fabrication to provide sustainable living standards via desktop manufacturing technologies, they have not been widely implemented. Adopting personal fabrication practices in line with circular and distributed production and suitable for lay citizens face environmental, socioeconomic, and sociotechnical barriers. This article aims to identify critical factors that support a citizen-driven transition to alternative ways of production and consumption capable of creating sustainable built environments. Findings suggest that opportunities lie in developing enabling tools to empower users, improve the embedded sustainability in open-source resources, increase appropriateness to local contexts, and facilitate knowledge transfer between makers and the general public.<br>da Costa Junior, J., Tenorio, R., &amp; dos Santos, A.

Thus, the success of such socio-technical transformation requires innovation processes that are socially inclusive to local communities in terms of social norms, capabilities, knowledge, economic reality, available resources, and functional requirements, sharing a set of principles and vision known as grassroots innovation processes (Smith et al., 2014).

Caccere and Santos (2017) raise concern that the widespread adoption of digital fabrication technologies in the everyday life of people might lead to the exclusion of technological illiterate users. (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RB2T37HW?page=6&amp;annotation=8GNNYB3W" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RB2T37HW?page=6&amp;annotation=8GNNYB3W" target="_blank">6</a>)<br>
Making CAD simpler to use.&nbsp;<br>
For technological illiterate users technology could be avoided by using scanners. Let them make a physical product using crafts and digitalize and print it, similar to a copy printer.
<br>Although digital tools eliminate the need for mechanical skills, users still face technical challenges when designing 3D objects that exhibit complex mechanical behaviors (Baudisch and Mueller, 2017). Similar challenges are faced by makers when fabricating solutions with high technical complexity, such as products comprised of a higher number of functions and physical parts. Another issue raised in the literature is the need for diversity and inclusion in makerspaces, which are often expert-driven (or expert-led) environments (Fleischmann et al., 2016), and mainly attract or are populated mainly by well-educated, technologyoriented, male users (Voigt et al., 2017; Walter-Herrmann and Büching, 2013).

(<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RB2T37HW?page=7&amp;annotation=QE8PMRBU" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RB2T37HW?page=7&amp;annotation=QE8PMRBU" target="_blank">7</a>)<br>The authors recommend the use of myceliumbased composites for digital fabrication due to their low environmental impact and properties such as heat resistance, thermal resistance, lightweight, shapeable, and hydrophobic (Appels et al., 2019), which are particularly suitable for prototyping (Vasquez et al., 2020).

It is noteworthy to mentioned, however, that centralized mass production has been criticized for disregarding the social and environmental cost of its practices on name of efficiency and costsaving (dos Santos et al., 2021).

For example, extending a product's life through easy repairing and customization represents opportunities linking circular economy principles to personal fabrication (Fleischmann et al., 2016).

The wiliness to learn technological skills and gain a better understanding of digital fabrications processes is a prerequisite to effectively achieve sustainable design outcomes (Fleischmann et al., 2016).
<br>in the context of personal fabrication, open hardware and software can be used to customize, repair, and upgrade existing solutions in the market to increase accessibility (Armstrong, 2020).

This is particularly relevant in low-income contexts, where the major social benefits and disruptive social innovations might occur.

To tackle this challenge, adaptive solutions and enabling tools can be created to empower people and allow for adaptation to their knowledge and skill level and local context.

 <br><br>Over the last few decades, there has been an increasing interest in manufacturing complex three-dimensional (3D) structures for theoretical models. This has escalated the research in the field of electronic devices fabrication. Advancement in electronics technology has led to electronics fabrication and manufacturing of new materials within a smaller lattice space. Several conductive materials like copper, carbon fibre, silver, graphene, and ferrites are available in the form of filaments. These filaments ease the fabrication of electronic devices through existing additive manufacturing techniques with minimal modifications. Additive manufacturing techniques provide significant competitive advantages due to their ability to adapt to the part's geometrical complexity and customized design to be manufactured. This review mainly focuses on using or the need for additive manufacturing in electronic device fabrication. Further, this article outlines the advantages of using additive manufacturing in the different fields of electronics fabrication, such as power electronics, sensors, batteries, solar cells, stretchable electronics, and embedded and wearable electronics. This paper also focuses on the methodologies adopted in additive manufacturing to overcome the issues encountered by conventional manufacturing methods.<br>Dhinesh, S.

 <br><br>This article introduces the concept of distributed economies (DE) as a fresh strategy to guide industrial development towards becoming more sustainable. The concept calls for a transformation in the industrial system towards DE departing from the socio-economically and environmentally unsustainable dynamics associated with large-scale, centralised production units that are favoured by neoclassical economic drivers. With DE, a selective share of production is distributed to regions where a diverse range of activities are organised in the form of small-scale, flexible units that are synergistically connected with each other and prioritise quality in their production. However, rather than the total abolishment of large-scale production, our argument concentrates on finding a renewed balance between large- and small-scale and between resource flows that take place within and across regional boundaries. Other desirable characteristics of production units compatible with DE are elaborated. The paper concludes by calling for the deployment of the vast amount of globally and regionally available knowledge for the formation of regionally adapted strategies to create dynamically “self-organizing” business environments.<br>Johansson, A., Kisch, P., &amp; Mirata, M.

He felt that the former was ill represented in the adminis- tration and as a consequence many important decisions were taken with insufficient understanding of the basic facts.

I think this is better described as: those who exploit and those who are exploited.<br>
This is because the former statement implies other (non-western) populations want to be like the west. Inherently sketching a western centric picture.
<br>there is an urgent need to question the current support and coordination structures for fostering in- novation, which are focussed solely on the amount and rate of innovation rather than on the orientation of innovation towards identified needs.

Even though I agree with this statement it does seem subjective.
<br>Sustainable development is the commonly accepted new paradigm. It speaks about development, economic as well as technical, not sacrifice, and as such can be accepted by all, poor and wealthy alike.

very conformist statement, I think. Can there really be poor and wealthy people in a sustainable system? Isn't equality part of sustainability?

I don't think this is what our economy achieves in the end. This has become more apparant last decade.
<br>the economic laws that have so successfully governed, at least the western economy, do not provide the right signals for development becoming more sustainable.

This also fails to mention that the opesit might be true. The current economic system might have been so "successfull" because of its exploitation of the planet and minorities.
<br>Growth at the expense of competitors has been the prime strategy, economy of scale being the lone star of guidance.

In the light of average figures, the world is becoming a better place to live, but closer inspection of the figures reveals that success seems to breed success, the rich get richer while the poor remain poor. Or worse still, the number of poor in the world increases. This trend seems to hold for both developing countries and industrial countries alike.

 <br><br>The global society faces an existential threat if it fails to meet current and future material needs of its populations, while staying within the carrying capacity of our planet. An approach that has been put forwards to address this complex challenge is to aim to close our society's material flows through introduction of a Circular Economy (CE). This paper provides an extensive literature review to understand the evolution of material circularity concepts and strategies, and their potential for increasing material efficiency and reduce environmental impacts towards meeting the material needs of our societies in an environmentally sustainable manner. Based on the review it can be concluded that CE may have a strong potential to help address the challenge. However, this requires broadening the focus of CE from technical and economical to political and socio-cultural dimensions, adopting a whole-systems approach, aiming to redesign economic and social relations to not just reduce the impact humanity has on the environment but actually achieve a balance in human-nature relations with a planetary boundary thinking. Pursuing purely technical and economic avenues to implement CE for increasing material circulation and sustainable growth on the foundation of our current linear economic system, will not achieve its full potential. It will not be sustainable but continue to produce the challenges that we currently have.<br>Kara, S., Hauschild, M., Sutherland, J., &amp; McAloone, T. (2022).

Limits to Growth was one of the first instances where a thorough analysis of the potential implications of the linear economic system was reported [94]. The contribution from the report that, in particular, gained notoriety was the fact that ‘a linear, infinite increase in production and prosperity is simply not possible in a world with finite resources.’ This idea was solidified in Jeremy Rifkin’s 1980 book, ‘Entropy- a New World View’ [122] which delved into the historical nature of linear development and its consequences.

See my comments made later on Natural Capitalism.
<br>‘Natural capitalism’, a concept coined by [58] aims to not only protect the biosphere but also improve profits and competitiveness. Based on some very simple changes to the business practices, it aims to make resource use more productive. (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VVGQYZWX?page=7&amp;annotation=RR8C4IU9" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VVGQYZWX?page=7&amp;annotation=RR8C4IU9" target="_blank">7</a>)<br>Move to a solutions-based business model by moving away from traditional business models selling goods to selling services to provide the solution e.g., providing mobility rather than selling cars and providing illumination, rather than selling lightbulbs. (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VVGQYZWX?page=8&amp;annotation=RG5LBDVQ" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VVGQYZWX?page=8&amp;annotation=RG5LBDVQ" target="_blank">8</a>)<br>
This is probably the main difference with distributed economies.
<br>The system of Natural capitalism doesn't recognise the inherent unsustainability of the inequality that capitalism brings. distributed economies argue for co-existence with nature while natural capitalism is always about ownership.<br>For example,&nbsp;<br>
how do you make sure monopolies don't exist and competition is enforced while also making sure the environment and people don't suffer under this?<br>
How do you forgo inequality created by ownership and meritocracy?<br>
This approach to a PSS centered economy will cause capitalists to own everything while workers own nothing, since everything they use is offered trough a service and is not actually their property. This system might work if all capital is communally owned and "rented" out to people by the community. However, with private ownership the risk of exploitation of wealth and power is too large.<br>Reinvest in natural capital by restoring, sustaining, and expanding the planet’s ecosystems so that they can produce their vital services and biological resources even more abundantly since the nature is seen as the most fundamental form of capital.

This negates that capitalism is about exploiting these resources for profit.

 <br><br>This paper presents an integrated literature review on how the environmental sustainability of distributed production is studied in a variety of disciplinary sources. The notion of distributed production suggests an alternative to mass production that differs in scale, location and consumer–producer relationship. Understanding its environmental implications (and thereby dematerialization potential) is regarded pertinent and timely. Key themes in the review included how distributed production can promote product longevity and closed material loops, as well as localizing production. New and closer ties between producer and consumer seemed central discussions but were underdeveloped with regard to sustainability potential. Empirical work was seen especially in research on Additive Manufacturing Processes, while the bulk of the studies were conceptual explorations with little testing in the real world as yet. This affirms the emerging nature of the topic and points to a clear need for more (and more diverse) empirical research. The review summarizes the opportunities for greater environmental sustainability as well as potential threats that could serve to guide and improve these novel practices today. It sets the stage for ‘distributed production’ to be examined as its own phenomenon by proposing how it can be characterized and suggests that a research agenda could build upon the work initiated here.<br>Kohtala, C.

There is hence need for discussion on the valuing systems behind distributed production activities involving material goods.

<br>Because of the heavy emphasis on frameworks and iden- tifying environmental benefits, combined with the lack of, for instance, real-life case studies, the environmental harms (poten- tially) concomitant with a decentralized production paradigm remained unacknowledged.

How about fab labs (and others)? In these spaces safety can be regulated and measured.

smaller supply chain and local production may give more controll and transparancy of suppliers. Possibly even trough regulations.<br>

 <br><br>Distributed manufacturing is rapidly proliferating to citizen level via the use of digital fabrication equipment, especially in dedicated “makerspaces”. The sustainability benefits of citizens' personal fabrication are commonly endorsed. However, to assess how these maker practitioners actually deal with environmental issues, these practitioners and their practices need to be studied. Moreover research on the environmental issues in personal fabrication is nascent despite the common perception that the digital technologies can become disruptive. The present paper is the first to report on how practitioners assess the environmental sustainability of future practices in this rapidly changing field. It does so through an envisioning workshop with leading-edge makers. The findings show that these makers are well able to envision the future of their field. Roughly 25% of the issues covered had clear environmental implications. Within these, issues of energy use, recycling, reusing and reducing materials were covered widely by environmentally-oriented participants. In contrast, issues related to emerging technologies, materials and practices were covered by other participants, but their environmental implications remained unaddressed. The authors concluded there is a gap between different maker subcultures in their sustainability orientations and competences. Further research on the environmental aspects of real-life maker practices and personal fabrication technologies now could help avert negative impacts later, as the maker phenomenon spreads. This knowledge should also be directed to developing targeted environmental guidelines and solutions for personal fabrication users, which are currently lacking. Potential also lies in seeking to enhance dialogue between pro-environmental and new-technology-oriented practitioners through shared spaces, workshops and conferences.<br>Kohtala, C., &amp; Hyysalo, S.

Research question of this paper.
<br>Shared makerspaces are workshops with low-cost digital fabrication equipment, typically milling machines for making circuits or casting moulds (using wood, silicon, wax and plaster); vinyl cutters; desktop 3D printers (typically using ABS and PLA plastics); laser cutters (for usually plywood, cardboard and acrylic); and often electronics workstations for microprocessor programming and project prototyping.

As I see it a (maybe not fully realized) open source approach to artifact design.
<br>The number of makerspaces worldwide is growing rapidly: to date there are over 450 fab labs and 1000 active hackerspaces (FabLabs, 2015; HackerspaceWiki, 2015), listings that do not account for independent spaces. (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/44X7R4CI?page=2&amp;annotation=S9RF8PV5" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/44X7R4CI?page=2&amp;annotation=S9RF8PV5" target="_blank">2</a>)<br>participatory backcasting (Mont et al., 2014).

other participants expressed sustainability concerns in 11% of all solutions while the sustain- ability faction did so in 6%. This seems to imply a comfort the sustainability group felt with expressing their environmental con- cerns in general trends but less certainty when it came to actual solutions in a makerspace.

The other participants showed more interest in the environmental issues in making activities themselves: dealing with the materials and the equipment, suggesting better fabbing processes and considering energy con- sumption. In waste prevention the sustainability group tended to focus on reuse, while the other participants offered solutions to combat waste and mistakes within the fabbing process itself, as well as pointing out the need for better (cleaner) materials in personal fabrication. (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/44X7R4CI?page=9&amp;annotation=NN8AGV3P" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/44X7R4CI?page=9&amp;annotation=NN8AGV3P" target="_blank">9</a>)<br>The pro-environmental makers thus had limited engagement with unrecognised issues, and their engagement was also highly selective within this category: new materials and emerging tech- nologies did not draw their attention. Also elsewhere in the trend- solution mapping space, trends with clear sustainability implica- tions such as nano-technology, new material toxicity and changes in mass production were not addressed by the sustainability- oriented faction.

Environmental sustainability thus does not appear to be an overarching aspect of all or even themajority ofissues the makers consider relevant in future makerspaces.

The topics that participants expressed as relating to sustainabilit<br>
focused especially on repair, reducing, reusing and recycling of ma<br>
terials, electricity consumption and possibilities for more sustainabl<br>
materials and energy.

implications related mainly to emerging topics of making such a<br>
DIYbio, new materials such as nano based (Helland and Kastenholz<br>

manufacturing displacing mass production.

Often, the analysis of the business environment and  the derivation of specific needs to be solved build the starting point of a DSR project. However,  also situations exist in which needs have already been studied and can be taken from extant  research. (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T8EJ7T99?page=6&amp;annotation=JCI6KYI9" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T8EJ7T99?page=6&amp;annotation=JCI6KYI9" target="_blank">6</a>)<br>DSR analyses the (academic) knowledge base in that it studies to which extent design  knowledge is already available to solve a problem of interest. Such knowledge can take the  form of theories, frameworks, instruments or design artifacts, such as constructs, models,  methods or instantiations. In case knowledge is already available to solve a problem identified,  this knowledge can be applied following “routine design”, which does not constitute DSR. Else,  DSR sets out to create an innovative solution to the problem, which, in most cases, builds on  existing parts of a solution and combines, revises, and extends extant design knowledge. (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T8EJ7T99?page=6&amp;annotation=2CJETH3K" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T8EJ7T99?page=6&amp;annotation=2CJETH3K" target="_blank">6</a>)<br>The  design activities comprise of “build” and “evaluate” activities, typically following multiple  iterations. In course of a DSR study, diverse research methods are applied, including those well  established in social science research, such as interviews, surveys, literature reviews, or focus  groups.

In short, three types of  DSR projects can be differentiated regarding the contribution they intend to make to DK: (1)  projects that contribute to design entities, (2) projects that contribute to both design entities and  design theory, and (3) projects that contribute to design theory without developing a design  entity as part of the same project.

 <br><br>The technological evolution of the 3-D printer, widespread internet access and inexpensive computing has made a new means of open design capable of accelerating self-directed sustainable development. This study critically examines how open source 3-D printers, such as the RepRap and Fab@home, enable the use of designs in the public domain to fabricate open source appropriate technology (OSAT), which are easily and economically made from readily available resources by local communities to meet their needs.  The current capabilities of open source 3-D printers is reviewed and  a new classification scheme is proposed for OSATs that are technically feasible and economically viable for production. Then, a methodology for quantifying the properties of  printed parts and a research trajectory is outlined to extend the existing technology to provide complete village-level fabrication of OSATs.  Finally, conclusions are drawn on the potential for open source 3-D printers to assist in driving sustainable development.<br>Pearce, J., Blair, C. M., Laciak, K., Andrews, R., Nosrat, A., &amp; Zelenika-Zovko, I. (2010). 3-D Printing of Open Source Appropriate Technologies for Self-Directed Sustainable Development.

(<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HZI9KY7S?page=&amp;annotation=XPGWE52H" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HZI9KY7S?page=&amp;annotation=XPGWE52H" target="_blank"></a>)<br>One cause of this is that when appropriate solutions are found, they are not  well-documented or shared and there is little access to the information for other communities that could put it to  use (Kanter, et al., 2009). (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HZI9KY7S?page=2&amp;annotation=QS7N2E8M" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HZI9KY7S?page=2&amp;annotation=QS7N2E8M" target="_blank">2</a>)<br>Open source  appropriate technology (OSAT) has the ability to harness the power of distributed peer review, source  transparency, and the gift culture from the open source movement/academia and the contextual development  capacity of ATs (Pearce, 2009; Pearce &amp; Mushtaq, 2009). In parallel to the open source movement in software,  OSAT allows technology users to be developers simultaneously and share the open “source code” of their  physical AT designs. Thus, rather than programming code, the “source code” for AT are material lists, directions,  specifications, designs, 3-D CAD, techniques, and scientific theories needed to build, operate, and maintain AT.  Users are free to use and modify the “source code” from any shared AT and, via the internet, can engage in a  massive parallel world-wide peer review process to determine the best practices and solutions. (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HZI9KY7S?page=2&amp;annotation=CSJ86SLV" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HZI9KY7S?page=2&amp;annotation=CSJ86SLV" target="_blank">2</a>)<br>One of the key  impediments to the more rapid development of OSAT is the lack of means of production of open source  technologies beyond a specific technical complexity. (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HZI9KY7S?page=2&amp;annotation=YDAJ4SL3" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HZI9KY7S?page=2&amp;annotation=YDAJ4SL3" target="_blank">2</a>)<br>The most  important goal to this community is self replication of the machine (Sells, et al., 2009) and currently Mendel can  print 6.83% of its parts by number (counting each bolt, washer, and nut as separate piece), but 48% excluding  nuts, bolts, and washers (RepRap, 2010). The remainder of the machine can be built using locally sourced  materials and electronic equipment that can be bought or put together (Sells et al., 2009). (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HZI9KY7S?page=3&amp;annotation=U2APM3AN" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HZI9KY7S?page=3&amp;annotation=U2APM3AN" target="_blank">3</a>)<br>3-D printing access  could enable technologies, which previously were not considered to be AT (due to the non-availability of  replacement parts or resources to maintain them), to become sustainable by the local communities. (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HZI9KY7S?page=4&amp;annotation=CRS37GX5" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HZI9KY7S?page=4&amp;annotation=CRS37GX5" target="_blank">4</a>)<br>An open-source printer would be an outlet and a reason for having high-tech CAD and design skills. It would encourage training and provide meaningful sustainable employment in which skilled workers could give  back to their community, becoming product designers or technical support experts for the printers. (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HZI9KY7S?page=4&amp;annotation=D5V2HTTG" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HZI9KY7S?page=4&amp;annotation=D5V2HTTG" target="_blank">4</a>)<br>3-D printing is most applicable to components that are i)  small, ii) highly customizable, iii) expensive to manufacture/ship, iv) difficult to transport, v) have a large lead  time, vi) do not require precise machining and can handle small imperfections, and vii) can be made from  available, cheap, and technically viable feed stocks. (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HZI9KY7S?page=5&amp;annotation=37HTTF3A" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HZI9KY7S?page=5&amp;annotation=37HTTF3A" target="_blank">5</a>)<br>As outlined in Sections 2 and 3, it is clear that the technology of OSAT 3-D printing is far from its evolutionary  climax. For OSAT applications, the ideal functional requirements of a 3-D printer include: -Inexpensive machine ideally self-replicated and fabricated with locally available materials -Inexpensive feedstocks with locally available materials -Free and open access to designs, and designing software -Inexpensive and rapidly fabricated parts  -Low energy use and powered by locally available renewable energy resources (e.g. solar photovoltaic  cells) -Open/freely available technical support and knowledge -Socially acceptable use patterns -Minimal negative health, social and environmental effects of use or construction of the 3-D printer (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HZI9KY7S?page=6&amp;annotation=B9NZ3TK7" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HZI9KY7S?page=6&amp;annotation=B9NZ3TK7" target="_blank">6</a>)<br>It is critical that feed stocks be developed from locally-available materials in order to prevent the erosion of cost  advantages for local production. Using locally-available materials for fabricating OSAT not only ensures the  community in question will be less dependent on foreign assistance if there are problems with the technology,  which currently is a frequent occurrence (RepRap, 2010; Fab@home 2010), but it also creates a sense of  empowerment as technology is not handed out as a form of charity furthering dependence on foreign aid  (Gellerman, et al., 2009). (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HZI9KY7S?page=6&amp;annotation=98ACAGKM" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HZI9KY7S?page=6&amp;annotation=98ACAGKM" target="_blank">6</a>)<br>This can be accomplished through the use of feedstocks created from waste products  (e.g. plastic bags) or through the use of available local materials such as bio-polymers. The sheer abundance of  plastics in household waste (including bags, bottles, food and entertainment packaging) is a reality in most  non-rural communities (Al-Khatib, et al., 2010; Phillipe &amp; Culot, 2009), but this waste can be reused. (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HZI9KY7S?page=6&amp;annotation=2FVPWK7I" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HZI9KY7S?page=6&amp;annotation=2FVPWK7I" target="_blank">6</a>)<br>it is important to  diversify the feedstock material options as much as possible and to design and build the 3-D printers to be  versatile and able to adapt to the local needs of the community. Once again the fastest and easiest way to  facilitate such versatility is through some form of open source collaborative design (Buitenhuis, Zelenika, &amp;  Pearce, 2010).

(<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HZI9KY7S?page=8&amp;annotation=S4FZK5SZ" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HZI9KY7S?page=8&amp;annotation=S4FZK5SZ" target="_blank">8</a>)<br>The following properties  of 3-D printed items can be tracked and posted openly in an online database along with the CAD designs: i) print  accuracy obtained; ii) electricity consumed, iii) time to print; iv) quantity of materials required for production;  and v) mechanical properties including: strength of part (bending, breaking), yield stress (both tensile and shear),  elastic limit, elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, stress (F/A), and hardness. (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HZI9KY7S?page=8&amp;annotation=2Z7SQ2CJ" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HZI9KY7S?page=8&amp;annotation=2Z7SQ2CJ" target="_blank">8</a>)<br>Once the mechanical capabilities of 3-D printed parts are documented, the following method may be employed  to evaluate the suitability of 3-D printing to create proposed objects, both theoretically and through testing: i)  calculate expected forces on proposed objects through momentum or speed change calculations, or finite element  analysis modeling; ii) find typical breaking strengths of similar objects through the mechanical properties of the  standard manufacturing material to obtain an estimate of the strength required in the proposed object; iii) find  typical tolerances required through manufacturers of similar objects; iv) determine typical use conditions (i.e.  temperature and wear); v) compare economics of producing the part with the 3-D printer against other locally  available production methods and shipping + markup + purchase costs of having it made elsewhere; vi) and  finally consider the social and environmental impact of manufacturing the part with a 3-D printer against other  means or not at all.

For example, it will probably be  necessary to enable local training and knowledge transfer (both technical/social). A business case will need to be  made for the project and local demand for printed AT will need to be quantified. In addition, both the  requirements for local leadership of the project and leaders will need to be identified for each community.  Research into meeting such social requirements may lead to further technical requirements and improvements.

Mycellium-based materials have had an exponential growth in the last years as a low energy and abundant agricultural by-product waste user, due to its simplicity of manufacturing and environmental sustainability. The wide range of experimental approaches on its applicability has been moderately unexplored in the construction industry. The applicability and practicality of mycelium based materials are currently non-standardised and existing data on the composition and processes variables are scarce. The scalability, biofabrication methods for mycelium composites, material properties of construction components are being tested at the Bio-Based Materials Design Lab.<br>

The emergence of manufacturing at a personal level has been supported by the declining cost of desktop digital fabrication technologies, the increase of distributed production through collaborative making spaces and the dissemination of the Maker Culture on the internet. This paradigm shift in production is called personal fabrication and provides people with access to new production practices, increased capability and cutting-edge technologies.

The researcher suggests that capacity building for traditional bamboo technology can be implemented in design education by improving the process of the project validation/review, introducing algorithmic, parametric and generative modelling tools (AAD/CAD), introducing alternative rapid prototyping tools (CAM), and finally, introducing evaluation tools that contribute to translate traditional techniques from design to prototyping and to bridge educational backgrounds as these become a design language of reference.

 <br><br>Custom-tailored mass production appears to be post-industrial and neo-craft in one. This ambiguity suggests that it can be approached from two different directions: from the side of the industry and from the side of the craftsman trade. Whereas there are numerous examples for the path from mass production to the mass customization, the development potentials of skilled trade businesses have barely been examined. Precedence for this is being set by the research project C-furniture. Its objective is the implementation of a strategy of mass customization through a network of CAD/ CAM-supported joinery workshops and a renewed competitiveness with regard to craftsmanship production.

If it can find a friendly location close to its customers, it will prefer to settle there. This proximity promotes mutual understanding. You can meet customers in person more frequently, get to know their needs and concerns, and develop your products precisely according to their wishes. In addition, the probability of something going wrong decreases the closer the product is to the customer." (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/C2ZWABJJ?page=2&amp;annotation=ZT457MUG" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/C2ZWABJJ?page=2&amp;annotation=ZT457MUG" target="_blank">2</a>)<br>In order to achieve cost-efficient production, the furniture design has to conform to the requirements of digital technologies like CNCmilling and laser cutting. (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/C2ZWABJJ?page=3&amp;annotation=56JAMUVN" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/C2ZWABJJ?page=3&amp;annotation=56JAMUVN" target="_blank">3</a>)<br>"virtual product" – i.e., a ready-for-use dataset for machine control – can be "materialized" with computercontrolled tools, just as a text or graphic can be printed by a laser printer. Ideally, the furniture would be fully defined through its digital production program, thereby allowing it to be sent as a data file via the Internet and produced identically at any given location by a company that has CNC technology, but in countless versions with regard to size, material, color, etc., according to the wishes of individual customers.

This task could be fulfilled by the management of an "electronic directory" by a product publisher (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/C2ZWABJJ?page=4&amp;annotation=E9CUKRSY" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/C2ZWABJJ?page=4&amp;annotation=E9CUKRSY" target="_blank">4</a>)
<br>
Monitisation could also be rethought trough payment on production (somehow).&nbsp;<br>
Even a whole market could be created with people creating requests for (digital) products they want but can't create themselves, against a price. Designers could also start fund raisers for their digital products.<br>
Surely there are more approaches and even more if straying from traditional monitisation schemes
<br>Since a wide variety of materials like wood, wood-based materials, acrylic, glass, metal, etc. can be processed with the digital tools, the neo-craft production of the future will organize itself in a crossmaterial and cross-craft way. This "technofacture" will be equipped with cutting-edge technology but will function following the old model of manufacturing in a decentralized and custom-tailored way. (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/C2ZWABJJ?page=4&amp;annotation=GZZTETL3" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/C2ZWABJJ?page=4&amp;annotation=GZZTETL3" target="_blank">4</a>)<br>
Sustainability will be a new factor to consider within this old framework.
<br>A combination of an Internet presence and a local product gallery that presents patterns, material samples, etc. and consults with customers with respect to the configuration of their furniture seems more favorable. The product galleries, which require less exhibition space and lower margins than a traditional furniture store, can be operated within cities. (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/C2ZWABJJ?page=4&amp;annotation=VZ9FFZW2" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/C2ZWABJJ?page=4&amp;annotation=VZ9FFZW2" target="_blank">4</a>)<br>
quite similar to the idea of Ikea's in city center stores
<br>In order to express the increasing influence of the customer on the design, which not only comprises the measurements, materials and colors but also the artistic manner of surface design, the term codesigner was coined. (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/C2ZWABJJ?page=4&amp;annotation=MUXN4Z34" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/C2ZWABJJ?page=4&amp;annotation=MUXN4Z34" target="_blank">4</a>)<br>Decentralized production, service and marketing result in reduced importing and exporting of materials and an expansion of local economies (Bierter 1999). Additionally, customized, high-quality furniture and connected services will be of practical and aesthetical value for a longer period of time. The high quality of the materials and production, and the design, which aims at the possibility of expanding and repairing, enable greater durability. But the consideration of customer wishes and the integration of the future user as a codesigner also favor the appreciation of and identification with the product and encourage long-term use. (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/C2ZWABJJ?page=4&amp;annotation=29IDU72E" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/C2ZWABJJ?page=4&amp;annotation=29IDU72E" target="_blank">4</a>)<br>
I think unsustainable patterns in AM are mostly concerned with the high focus on novelty and technology. This mindset enforces the impulse to want what ever is newest, increasing production, consumption and waste. Reducing this effect would have to be by ensuring product sustainability by design, shifting mentality within makers communities and shifting away from personally owned production units and materials to communally owned.
<br>the design team of the C-Lab of HfG developed a collection of "virtual furniture" compiled in a database (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/C2ZWABJJ?page=4&amp;annotation=CJFX8SS8" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/C2ZWABJJ?page=4&amp;annotation=CJFX8SS8" target="_blank">4</a>)<br>
Something similar could be made for sustainability. Making a database of tooling, materials and practices ensuring easy repairability, adjustability and with this sustainability.
<br>Additionally, a so-called folding technique is employed in the furniture designs. It allows for the folding of coated panels into furniture bodies, similar to origami. The boards, which have a flexible, tear-proof coating, are milled in a V-shape via CNC and then folded; the coating serves as a connecting joint. (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/C2ZWABJJ?page=5&amp;annotation=NK7ARVVB" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/C2ZWABJJ?page=5&amp;annotation=NK7ARVVB" target="_blank">5</a>)<br>The furniture will be presented through pictures but also through virtual reality as VR objects. Customers can chose from the various furniture types just as they would in a traditional pattern book and supported by the product configuration tool – can create a piece of furniture that meets with their individual needs in terms of function, size, shape, material and color. The versions are created via dialogue boxes and mouseclicks. The configuration tool automatically checks the plausibility of the design and calculates the price. (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/C2ZWABJJ?page=8&amp;annotation=AYEUTE6G" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://franstw.github.io/pfwiki/zotero://open-pdf/library/items/C2ZWABJJ?page=8&amp;annotation=AYEUTE6G" target="_blank">8</a>)<br>
Possibly a same approach could be taken towards sustainable design. Intergrating PLC into CAD and this way giving live sustainability feedback. Current PLC ofcourse doesn't consider everything but you could go quite far if you have a proper database and model.
<br>In contrast to this, the decentralized mini- plant will exclusively focus on the custom-tailored production of its collection, and on direct customer contact and services throughout the product life cycle. The mini-plant will therefore be smaller than the usual trade business as the "smallest possible production unit.
